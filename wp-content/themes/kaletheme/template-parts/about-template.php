<div class="abt-cont"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-184" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/headshot.png" alt="" width="220" height="220" />Yo I'm Konrad, an analyst / developer based in Philly with over 5 years of experience in various industries including Fintech, Investment Management, Telecommunication, Insurance and Nonprofit.
I develop responsive and beautiful website for small businesses and entrepernuers.
My greatest joy is helping my clients achieve their goals. Throughout my career, my role has always been centered around the client. How do I make my clients' lives, experience, and relationship with the company better? It is such an amazing experience to assist my partners in creating effective marketing campaigns and help them drive sales. My goal in development not only help my client drive new sales but also present their brand to their target audience and create successful long term partnerships.
Things I always keep in mind when I build my sites: W3C standards, implementation of SEO strategies, capabilities of different web browsers, and cross platform as well as marketing strategies and building an organic social media presence.
My Clients and Colleagues would describe be as having a very good attention to detail, quick learner and fun to work it :) I love being in new and challenging situations, I think it makes me better both as a professional and personal.
Creativity and passion has been key to my personal success in analytics, development and management.
The world is changing at an incredible pace, and I keep myself educated on everything to make sure you won't be left behind. Iâ€™m known for implementing the latest technologies and staying on top of the latest design trends.
If you're looking for a heads-down, micromanaged, do-as-he's-told developer, then I am not your guy. If you're looking for a natural leader, who inspires confidence, capable of making decisions, improves morale, and finds creative and effective solutions to challenges that arise, here I am. But don't take my word for it, check out my written recommendations.
Please contact me if you have any more questions and we can get work.</div>
