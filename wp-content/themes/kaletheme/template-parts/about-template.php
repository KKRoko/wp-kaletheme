    Yo I'm Konrad, I'm an analyst / developer based in Philly. I have over 5 years of experience
    developing websites and analyzing data for businesses and entreprenuers in various industries including Fintech, Investment Management, Telecommunication,
     Insurance and Non-profits .
  <br />
  My greatest joy is helping my clients achieve their goals. Throughout my career,
   my role has always been centered around the client. It is such a cool
   experience to assist my partners in creating web sites that help
   them drive sales. My goal in development not only help my client drive new sales
    but also present their brand to their target audience and create successful
     long term partnerships.
  <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   My clients and colleagues would describe be as having a very good attention
  to detail, quick learner and fun to work it :) I love being in new and challenging
  situations, I think it makes me better both as a professional and personal.
  Creativity and passion has been key to my personal success in analytics,
  development and management. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things I always keep in mind when I build my sites: W3C standards, implementation
  of SEO strategies, capabilities of different web browsers, and cross platform as
  well as marketing strategies and building an organic social media presence. <br  />
 <br  />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology is changing at an incredible pace, and I keep myself educated on
   everything to make sure you won't be left behind. Iâ€™m known for implementing
    the latest technologies and staying on top of the latest design trends.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're looking for a heads-down, micromanaged, do-as-he's-told developer,
  then I am not your guy. If you're looking for a natural leader, who inspires
  confidence, capable of making decisions, improves morale, and finds creative
  and effective solutions to challenges that arise, here I am. But don't take my
   word for it, check out my written recommendations. <br />
  Please contact me if you have any more questions and we can get work.
